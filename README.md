This repository features a curated collection of Power BI projects demonstrating real-world data integration, modeling, and visualization techniques. It includes interactive dashboards built on diverse datasets—such as sales performance, HR analytics, and sports—leveraging Power Query and DAX for calculated insights. This project showcases data cleaning, modeling, DAX calculations, and visual storytelling through Power BI. I’ve also explored advanced features such as PBIP (Power BI Project) structure. This repository reflects my learning journey and passion for transforming raw data into actionable insights.
